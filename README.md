# QJasper Gruvbox i3 theme and config

Here is my preferred configuration for my programming setup using Endeavour OS and i3-gaps.

## Instructions
1. Clone into the home directory using the command:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mexiquin/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
2. From within the ```bin/.bin``` directory, run the ```dotfiles-sync``` script to create the needed symlinks 


This repo contains everything that you should need to get started, including:
* i3 configuration files
* Supporting scripts for i3
* custom scripts for various activities (constantly changing)
* Wallpaper images that match the theme
